"""Platform and variant definitions — the one declarative table.

The PowerShell era hardcoded a different variant matrix in each script:
compile_xbox360.ps1 had seven variants, build_xbox360_resources.ps1 had a single
fixed define set, and compile_pc_bpr.ps1 had another. Nothing reconciled them, so
"the X360 build" meant different things depending on which script you ran.

Two build modes, because the old scripts really were doing two different jobs:

  resource  compile each technique's VS and PS separately (/T vs_3_0, /E VS_Main)
            and pack the result into ShaderProgramBuffer .dat pairs under the
            game's own resource ids. This is what ships.

  effect    compile the whole .fx as an effect (/T fx_2_0) into a .fxo. Nothing
            consumes the .fxo — it is a compile check across the variant matrix,
            which is why it can afford to build seven define sets.

Output paths are deliberately unchanged from the PowerShell layout so existing
extracted-bundle scratch dirs and deploy configs keep working.
